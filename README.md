This command-line tool allows users to retrieve the weather forecast for a specific city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It provides current temperature and humidity data and displays a graph representing the forecast for the upcoming days.

Built during the GitHub Copilot Hackathon 2023 organised by Microsoft. 
Please note that I had 10 days to make this command line tool using python as I got to know about this hackathon little later in which I had to learn, ideate, and develop it all by myself.

For your reference and better understanding I have also attached the output snippets.
